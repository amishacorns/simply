"""The layer's token exchange: one DMA program carried by three
kernels, on a power-of-two mesh of 1 to MAX_SHARDS shards.

Layout. Shards pair up: shard s and s ^ 1 are mates, and the even shard is
the pair's representative. The representatives form a hypercube of n =
log2(shards) - 1 dimensions, and dimension d joins representative r to
r ^ (2 << d). A pair's rows are one block of the gathered buffer, and every
block reaches every representative along shortest paths in n rounds. Round
1 sends the pair's own block on every link. Round t forwards each block
that arrived in round t - 1 one link further, so a block at distance t
arrives in t equal parts over its t shortest paths, the part on a path
fixed by the rank of the path's last link among the block's links. Every
link carries the same bytes in every round, C(n - 1, t - 1) / t blocks in
round t, and (2^n - 1) / n blocks in all, the least any all-gather over the
links can carry. A block travels as PIECES equal pieces so a forward starts
as soon as the piece it needs has landed; pieces on one link land in the
order they were issued.

Mates. During quantization the representative and its mate exchange their
own rows a tile at a time. After each round the representative copies the
blocks that round brought to its mate, and the mate waits for those copies
before its first tile.

Kernels. start_transport is its own Pallas call behind the router: a
barrier, the shard's rows quantized to fp8 a tile at a time and shared with
the mate as they go, the routing message sent to every shard, round 1
issued. It returns the gathered-rows buffer and its semaphores with the
copies in flight (the DMA engine keeps moving bytes across a call boundary
and the semaphores keep their counts). The shard-tables kernel forwards the
middle rounds on its last grid step (forward_middle_rounds). The FFN
kernel's prologue waits for every copy (finish) before its first tile.

The schedule is static: sends(), arrivals() and the wait bookkeeping are
plain Python over relative addresses, so a test simulates the whole exchange
without a device, and the kernels only turn relative addresses into peers
with one XOR of the shard index.
