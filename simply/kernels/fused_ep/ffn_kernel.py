"""The expert FFN kernel: one Pallas TPU program computes one shard's experts
and pushes each result row to the shard that owns its token.

The program (kernel_body):

  prologue    the resident tables land (weight scales, biases). The weight
              matrices of the first `weight_prefetch` experts are issued. An
              all-shard barrier. In the layer, the transport's final
              waits, so every reader of the gathered token rows reads
              them complete. The first expert's first `row_fetch_ahead`
              tiles
              are issued.
  Visit loop  for each local expert with rows, most rows first:
                wait its weight matrices. Issue the refill for the expert
                `weight_prefetch` ahead into the slot the previous expert
                last read.
                For each tile of `tile_rows` rows, at result slot
                (tile count mod result_slots): wait the slot's earlier
                commits. Wait this tile's rows. Issue the tile
                `row_fetch_ahead` ahead. The two matmuls and the
                activation. The epilogue (row scale, weight scale, bias,
                fp8 quantization). Stage the rows and their scales in the
                slot. Commit the tile's part of every (expert, destination)
                run to the outgoing rows.
                Issue the next expert's first tiles. Drain the slots'
                commits. Push the expert's runs to their destination shards
                at true length (the own-shard run is copied locally).
  Drain       every push and commit still in flight. An all-shard barrier.
