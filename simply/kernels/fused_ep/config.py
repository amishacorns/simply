  """The layer's build-time settings.

  Attributes:
    result_slots: buffers a tile's result rows are staged in. A tile computes
      into one while earlier tiles' commits drain out of the others.
    row_fetch_ahead: tiles ahead of compute a tile's rows are fetched,
      into the slot its results will be staged in. Smaller than
      result_slots so that slot is free.
    weight_slots: the most buffers an expert's weight matrices are
      streamed into. The layer takes the largest count up to it whose VMEM
      estimate fits the chip's budget, so a wide expert runs at two.
    weight_prefetch: experts ahead of compute a weight refill is issued.
      Smaller than weight_slots so the refill's slot is not a live one.
    tables_blocks_per_step: routing blocks the tables kernels handle per
      grid step, each 128 pairs. The layer pads a shard's tokens so
      its pairs are a whole number of steps, so 0 (the default) lets the
      layer take, per call, the largest count up to
      TABLES_BLOCKS_PER_STEP_MAX that pads no further than the gather's
      own unit does.
    stream_block: columns of the intermediate per streamed weight block.
      0 chooses for the shape: whole-expert weight slots when they fit
      the VMEM budget, else the widest block that fits. A count forces
      the streamed build: the weight slots hold column blocks of one
      expert, a group of stream_rows token rows keeps its float32
      running sum in VMEM, and the intermediate is rounded per
      activation block, which has to divide the stream block.
    stream_rows: token rows per group of a streamed expert (the rows
      whose running sum is resident), a multiple of the tile height.
    vmem_fraction: the share of the chip's VMEM the kernels plan for
      (the weight-slot fit, the streaming choice, each program's limit).
    activation_block: how each matmul's input is rounded to fp8: 0 is
      one scale per token row over the whole width; a multiple of 128
      that divides hidden and inter is one scale per that many values
      of a row, for the token rows and the intermediate alike (512 fits
      every shape gated so far). With four-bit weights the block has
      to be the weight block.
    token_block: how the token rows are rounded to fp8 on their way into
      the up projection, when it differs from activation_block: None
      (the default) follows activation_block, except that a streamed
      expert (fp8 or bf16 weights) takes 0, the layer's choice; 0 is one
      scale per row
      over the whole width; a multiple of 128 dividing hidden is one
      scale per that many values. With activation_block set, a streamed
      expert rounds its intermediate per block (it has to), while the
      token rows need no blocked scale: token_block 0 leaves the up
      projection one plain matmul with a single rescale, where a blocked
      contraction rescales its accumulator once per block on the vector
      unit. With four-bit weights a nonzero token block has to be the
      weight block.
    intermediate: the rows between the two matmuls: "fp8" requantizes
      the activated rows to fp8 with one scale per row (or per
      activation block) and runs the down matmul in fp8; "bf16" keeps
      them in bfloat16, no requantization, and runs the down matmul in
      bfloat16 against a per-expert bfloat16 copy of w2 (whole-expert
      builds with fp8 or bf16 weights). A numerics choice: the gate
      records each form's error against the reference and its time.
    result_rows: "fp8" sends each expert's result rows between shards as
      fp8 with one scale per row; "bf16" sends bf16 rows, twice the
      bytes and no third rounding (the form of a bf16 combine).
    token_rows: "fp8" quantizes the token rows to fp8 with one scale per
      row (or per token block) before the dispatch, the largest of the
      kernel's roundings; "bf16" dispatches them as they are, twice the
      bytes and no rounding, and the up matmul runs in bf16: as the
      weights are with bf16 weights, or on a per-expert bf16 copy of w1
      with fp8 weights (whole-expert builds; not the block-scaled
      forms).
    elementwise_dtype: the element type the fp8 scaling products are
      formed in (the row quantizer, the intermediate, the result
      epilogue). "bfloat16", the default, is a packed bf16 multiply that
      leaves a second rounding to the compiler, so two compilations can
      differ by an fp8 step on a few percent of the values; it measured
      1.5 percent less layer time than float32 at 8192 tokens on the
      gate's model. "float32" rounds each product once, so every
      compilation, the eager reference and the Mosaic kernels agree to
      the bit. The scales, bias and activation run on the float32
      accumulators either way.
    combine_dtype: the element type of the weighted sum over a token's
      selected experts at the end of the layer: "float32", or "bfloat16"
      for the vector unit's packed rate at one bf16 rounding per term.
    row_scale_dtype: rounding of each row's quantization scale, float32
      or bfloat16. Whether bfloat16 is acceptable is a model-quality
      question, decided by evaluation.
    bounds_checks: a diagnostic build with Mosaic's bounds checks on every
      dynamic index. Slower, changes no value.
    gather_block_rows: rows per index-driven DMA of the sparse-core
      gather behind the combine, a whole number of 8-row blocks.
    gather_ring: the gather's DMAs in flight per subcore; the layer
      halves it while the ring's staging (block rows by row bytes by
      ring) exceeds the default's at 4096 lanes.
    scatter_chunk_pairs: the most routed pairs per chunk of the
      sparse-core row-tables scatter, a multiple of 128; the layer takes
      the largest count up to it that divides a subcore's run.
    scatter_ring: the scatter's chunks in flight per subcore.
    combine_tokens_per_tile: tokens per grid step of the combine's
      weighted sum, a whole number of 8-row blocks; the routing message
      pads the tokens to a multiple of it.
    combine_unroll: the weighted sum's token loop unroll, dividing
      combine_tokens_per_tile.
    activation_columns_per_pass: columns of the intermediate the FFN
      kernel activates and requantizes per pass, a multiple of 128.
    tables_zero_words: the fewest words of a row table the shard-tables
      kernel zeroes per grid step, a whole number of 1024-word tiles.
    weight_dma_priority: the DMA queue the expert weight refills issue
      on, 1 (off the token rows' in-order queue) or 0.
    sorted_rows: how the FFN kernel fetches each expert's input rows.
      False: one copy per row from the token buffer, the rows scattered
      there in token order (10,240 copies a call at 8192 tokens); the
      copies hide under the result push, which is the longer transfer.
      True: a sparse-core gather sorts the routed rows into expert
      order first (exact, exposed, about 34 us at 8192 tokens) and the
      kernel fetches each tile as one copy; the form a smaller result
      push stands on. Whole-expert builds only: a streamed build keeps
      the per-row fetch, and so does a width the gather cannot move or
      a table whose sort program is over the sparse core's program
      size. None (the default): sorted_rows_by_shape decides from the
      shard's experts and tokens.
    region_push: how the results go home. False: one copy per (expert,
      destination) run after each expert (num_shards copies, and as many
      for the scales, per expert). True: one copy per destination of the
      whole outgoing region after the last expert (the region and the
      destination's arrival area share one aligned layout).
